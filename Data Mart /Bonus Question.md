	from weekly_sales_cleaned
	where (week_number between 13 and 37) and calendar_year = 2020
	group by date, week_number, region, platform, age_band, demographics, customer_type),
	after_before_sales_cte as ( 
	select  region, platform, age_band, demographics, customer_type,
	sum(case when week_number between 13 and 24 then total_sales end) as before_sales,
	sum(case when week_number between 25 and 37 then total_sales end) as after_sales
	from packaging_sales
	group by region, platform, age_band, demographics, customer_type)
select (after_sales - before_sales) as change_in_sales, region, platform, age_band, demographics, customer_type,
round((after_sales - before_sales)/before_sales * 100, 2) as percent_change
from after_before_sales_cte
order by round((after_sales - before_sales)/before_sales * 100, 2)
